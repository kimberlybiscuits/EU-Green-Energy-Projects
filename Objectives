Todos:
1. Create filtered views/tibbles of relevant data - decide what columns to keep - DONE

Data: Organisations
What we need to know: Visualise Energy projects per EU *Country* and for *Organisations* per Country
Cols to keep: projectID, name, activityType, full address (street, postCode, city, country)

Data: Projects
Need to know: Identify Energy *Projects* per Country per *year*
Cols to keep: ids, startDates, totalCosts

Data: EuroSciVoc
Need to know: Identify *Energy* Projects per Country per year
Cols to keep: projectID, euroSciVocTitle

Data: Co2 Emissions
Need to know: Identify and Visualise *EU Countries* with the Most and Least CO2 *Emissions*
Cols to keep: country, year, iso_code, cumulative_co2

Data: EU country and names
Need to know: EU Countries
Data to keep: Filter EU country (rows/observations) # Remove non-EU countries
 
 
 
Filter by Green energy projects - title contains 'energy' DONE
Change EurSocTitle to topic DONE
Convert start date from string to datetime -> date yyyyMMdd, then extract the year, start_year DONE
Group the project ids by topic so that if one project has multiple topics, it's just one observation DONE
Check country names (e.g. Czechia -> Czech Republic) DONE

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Combine data: 
- Org 2020 + Org 2021 - stack rows
- EuroSciVoc 20 + 21 - stack
  - Convert projectID in 2020 from character to integer, can't combine mixed types
- Projects 20 + 21 - stack
- Organisations and projects - Join tables (inner join). Key column = project ID

Blend all data into one dataset - DONE


2. Deal with NAs and duplicates in filtered data
CO2 data: 22863 NAs cumulative_co2 - do we need to handle NAs in this dataset?

Check for duplicates


3. Make style changes
- Change column names to snake_case - DONE
- Sort columns as in pdf (e.g. ID first)
